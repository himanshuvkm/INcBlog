## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get INcBlog up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: `v18.x` or higher (LTS recommended)
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
*   **npm** (comes with Node.js), **Yarn**, or **pnpm**:
    ```bash
    npm -v
    # or
    yarn -v
    # or
    pnpm -v
    ```
*   **Git**:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himanshuvkm/INcBlog.git
    cd INcBlog
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project based on `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create manually) and populate it with your environment variables.

```env
# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET_HERE" # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`

# Database (Example for PostgreSQL with Prisma)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/incblog_db" 
# Or for MongoDB:
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/incblog_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Sentry (Optional, only if you're using Sentry)
SENTRY_DSN="YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE"

# Add any other API keys or sensitive variables here
# E.g., GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET for NextAuth providers
```
**Note:** For `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, generate a strong random string (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal).

### Database Setup (Example for Prisma)

If you're using Prisma with a database like PostgreSQL:

1.  **Update your Prisma schema:** (located in `prisma/schema.prisma` if present) based on your database and model requirements.
2.  **Generate Prisma client:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```
3.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```
    This will apply your schema to the database and create tables.

### First Run

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Key Directories and Files Explained:

*   **`app/`**: This is the core of the Next.js App Router.
    *   **`(root)/`**: A route group used to apply a shared layout (`layout.tsx`) to the main application pages, excluding other parts like a potential admin dashboard if it were outside this group.
    *   **`api/`**: Contains server-side API routes.
        *   `auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`: Handles all authentication-related API calls using NextAuth.js.
        *   `sentry-example-api/route.ts`: Demonstrates Sentry error tracking for API routes.
    *   **`startup/[id]/page.tsx`**: Dynamic page for displaying a single startup's details and related posts.
    *   **`startup/create/page.tsx`**: Page for users to create new startup-related content.
    *   **`user/[id]/page.tsx`**: Dynamic page for viewing individual user profiles.
    *   **`studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx`**: A catch-all dynamic route, highly suggestive of an integrated content management studio (e.g., Sanity.io Studio, or a custom CMS).
    *   **`globals.css`**: Contains global CSS styles, likely including Tailwind CSS directives.
*   **`auth.ts`**: Central configuration file for NextAuth.js.
*   **`components/`**: Houses all reusable React components, such as `Navbar.tsx` and `Ping.tsx`.
*   **`components.json`**: Configuration file, typically for `shadcn/ui` components, indicating a component library setup.

## üîß Configuration

INcBlog leverages environment variables for sensitive data and flexible configuration.

### Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains the following:

| Variable            | Description                                                                                             | Example Value                                                 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`      | The URL of your application. Crucial for NextAuth.js callbacks.                                         | `http://localhost:3000` or `https://incblog.vercel.app`      |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`   | A random string used to hash tokens, sign cookies, and generate cryptographic keys. **Crucial for security.** | `openssl rand -base64 32` output (e.g., `s+r5G...`)          |
| `DATABASE_URL`      | Connection string for your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).                                        | `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?schema=public`         |
| `SENTRY_DSN`        | Your Sentry Data Source Name for error tracking.                                                        | `https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0`            |
| `GITHUB_ID`         | Client ID for GitHub OAuth provider (if enabled in NextAuth.js)                                         | `your_github_client_id`                                       |
| `GITHUB_SECRET`     | Client Secret for GitHub OAuth provider (if enabled in NextAuth.js)                                     | `your_github_client_secret`                                   |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`  | Client ID for Google OAuth provider (if enabled in NextAuth.js)                                         | `your_google_client_id`                                       |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret for Google OAuth provider (if enabled in NextAuth.js)                                  | `your_google_client_secret`                                   |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Public Sentry DSN for client-side error tracking.                                                    | `https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0`            |

**Security Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. Use `.env.example` (if present) for guidance without including actual secrets.

### Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.js` file (not explicitly listed but standard for Next.js) allows for advanced configurations, such as image optimization, internationalization, or custom webpack settings.

```javascript
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Add your Next.js configurations here
  images: {
    domains: ['res.cloudinary.com', 'avatars.githubusercontent.com'], // Example for image sources
  },
  experimental: {
    appDir: true, // Enables the app directory
  },
  // Other configurations
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">Back to Top</a>)</p>

---

## üß™ Testing

INcBlog is built with testing in mind to ensure reliability and maintainability. While specific test files are not listed, it's expected to utilize common JavaScript testing frameworks.

### Running Tests

To execute the test suite (if configured with a framework like Jest and React Testing Library):

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

This command will run all tests in the project and provide a summary of the results.

### Code Coverage

To view code coverage reports (if configured):

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
# or
yarn test --coverage
# or
pnpm test --coverage
```

This will typically generate an HTML report in a `coverage/` directory, which you can open in your browser to see detailed coverage information.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Optional)

For more comprehensive testing of user flows, you might integrate an E2E testing framework like Cypress or Playwright.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">Back to Top</a>)</p>

---

## üöÄ Deployment

Deploying INcBlog is straightforward, especially with its Next.js foundation.

### Local Production Build

To build and run the application locally in production mode:

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    This command compiles the Next.js application for production, generating an optimized build in the `.next` directory.

2.  **Start the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm start
    ```
    The application will serve from `http://localhost:3000` in production mode.

### Cloud Deployment (Vercel Recommended)

Next.js applications are seamlessly deployed to Vercel, the creators of Next.js.

1.  **Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```

2.  **Log in to Vercel:**
    ```bash
    vercel login
    ```
    Follow the prompts to authenticate via email or GitHub.

3.  **Deploy your project:**
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```
    Vercel will detect that it's a Next.js project and guide you through the deployment process, asking for project name, scope, and linking to an existing Git repository. It will automatically detect and apply environment variables configured in your Vercel project settings.

    For subsequent deployments after pushing to your linked GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy.

### CI/CD Integration

While no explicit CI/CD workflow files are provided, you can easily set up GitHub Actions (or similar services) to automate your build and deployment process.

A typical `main.yml` workflow for a Next.js project might look like this:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm' # or 'yarn', 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # or yarn, pnpm

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage # if tests are configured

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
        env:
          NEXTAUTH_URL: "http://localhost:3000" # Dummy URL for build
          NEXTAUTH_SECRET: ${{ secrets.NEXTAUTH_SECRET }} # Use a dummy or real secret for build
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }} # Dummy for build or a test DB

  # deploy: # Optional: Add a deploy job for services like Vercel, Netlify, etc.
  #   needs: build
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Deploy to Vercel
  #       uses: vercel/actions@v1
  #       with:
  #         vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
  #         vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  #         vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```
**Note:** Remember to configure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, and Vercel-specific secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
